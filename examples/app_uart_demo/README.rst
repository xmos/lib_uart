Generic Uart Loopback Example
=============================

:scope: Example
:description: Application to demonstrate module_uart_rx and module_uart_tx running looped back on a single Slicekti core board.
:keywords: UART, demo
:boards: XA-SKC-L2

This application instantiates both the module_uart_rx and module_uart_tx components looped back to one another to demonstrate basic usage. It will be necessary to setup two connections on the 0.1" testpoints on the Slicekti core board prior to running the demo.
